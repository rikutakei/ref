abstract = {Most advanced solid tumors remain incurable, with resistance to chemotherapeutics and targeted therapies a common cause of poor clinical outcome. Intratumor heterogeneity may contribute to this failure by initiating phenotypic diversity enabling drug resistance to emerge and by introducing tumor sampling bias. Envisaging tumor growth as a Darwinian tree with the trunk representing ubiquitous mutations and the branches representing heterogeneous mutations may help in drug discovery and the development of predictive biomarkers of drug response.},

abstract = {All cancers are caused by somatic mutations; however, understanding of the biological processes generating these mutations is limited. The catalogue of somatic mutations from a cancer genome bears the signatures of the mutational processes that have been operative. Here we analysed 4,938,362 mutations from 7,042 cancers and extracted more than 20 distinct mutational signatures. Some are present in many cancer types, notably a signature attributed to the APOBEC family of cytidine deaminases, whereas others are confined to a single cancer class. Certain signatures are associated with age of the patient at cancer diagnosis, known mutagenic exposures or defects in DNA maintenance, but many are of cryptic origin. In addition to these genome-wide mutational signatures, hypermutation localized to small genomic regions, 'kataegis', is found in many cancer types. The results reveal the diversity of mutational processes underlying the development of cancer, with potential implications for understanding of cancer aetiology, prevention and therapy.},

abstract = {The hallmarks of cancer comprise six biological capabilities acquired during the multistep development of human tumors. The hallmarks constitute an organizing principle for rationalizing the complexities of neoplastic disease. They include sustaining proliferative signaling, evading growth suppressors, resisting cell death, enabling replicative immortality, inducing angiogenesis, and activating invasion and metastasis. Underlying these hallmarks are genome instability, which generates the genetic diversity that expedites their acquisition, and inflammation, which fosters multiple hallmark functions. Conceptual progress in the last decade has added two emerging hallmarks of potential generality to this list - reprogramming of energy metabolism and evading immune destruction. In addition to cancer cells, tumors exhibit another dimension of complexity: they contain a repertoire of recruited, ostensibly normal cells that contribute to the acquisition of hallmark traits by creating the "tumor microenvironment." Recognition of the widespread applicability of these concepts will increasingly affect the development of new means to treat human cancer. ?? 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Secretory factors that drive cancer progression are attractive immunotherapeutic targets. We used a whole-genome data-mining approach on multiple cohorts of breast tumours annotated for clinical outcomes to discover such factors. We identified Serine protease inhibitor Kazal-type 1 (SPINK1) to be associated with poor survival in estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) cases. Immunohistochemistry showed that SPINK1 was absent in normal breast, present in early and advanced tumours, and its expression correlated with poor survival in ER+ tumours. In ER- cases, the prognostic effect did not reach statistical significance. Forced expression and/or exposure to recombinant SPINK1 induced invasiveness without affecting cell proliferation. However, down-regulation of SPINK1 resulted in cell death. Further, SPINK1 overexpressing cells were resistant to drug-induced apoptosis due to reduced caspase-3 levels and high expression of Bcl2 and phospho-Bcl2 proteins. Intriguingly, these anti-apoptotic effects of SPINK1 were abrogated by mutations of its protease inhibition domain. Thus, SPINK1 affects multiple aggressive properties in breast cancer: survival, invasiveness and chemoresistance. Because SPINK1 effects are abrogated by neutralizing antibodies, we suggest that SPINK1 is a viable potential therapeutic target in breast cancer.},

abstract = {There is substantial evidence that high estrogen levels in postmenopausal women are associated with an increase in breast cancer risk, but such a relation has not yet been established in premenopausal women, despite biologic evidence that breast epithelial cell division rates are high during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle when estradiol and progesterone levels are high. The lack of total consistency among studies that have assessed estrogen differences, whether in breast cancer patients versus controls or in subgroups of the population characterized by different risk profiles for breast cancer, is not unexpected given the extraordinarily complex methodological issues that must be addressed in these studies. There has been a clear evolution over time in the level of sophistication of these types of studies, further decreasing the likelihood of finding consistent patterns in the literature. Other hormones may play an important role in breast cancer development as well. Experimental data are particularly compelling for a role of progesterone and prolactin, but hormonal studies in women are not entirely convincing regarding the role of these two hormones, nor is the literature nearly as extensive as it is for the estrogens. Studies of various androgens are even less consistent. Moreover, such studies suffer from a lack of precise hypotheses regarding how these hormones might directly alter risk.},

GEO provides a flexible and open design that facilitates submission, storage and retrieval of heterogeneous data sets from high-throughput gene expression and genomic hybridization experiments. GEO is not intended to replace in house gene expression databases that benefit from coherent data sets, and which are constructed to facilitate a particular analytic method, but rather complement these by acting as a tertiary, central data distribution hub. The three central data entities of GEO are platforms, samples and series, and were designed with gene expression and genomic hybridization experiments in mind. A platform is, essentially, a list of probes that define what set of molecules may be detected. A sample describes the set of molecules that are being probed and references a single platform used to generate its molecular abundance data. A series organizes samples into the meaningful data sets which make up an experiment. The GEO repository is publicly accessible through the World Wide Web at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo.},

abstract = {Black women with breast cancer are less likely than white women to be diagnosed while their disease is still at a localized stage. Racial differences in the prevalence of obesity in the United States have also been documented. This study was undertaken to determine the extent to which the observed racial difference in stage at diagnosis of breast cancer could be explained by racial differences in obesity, specifically severe obesity. This was a population-based, retrospective study of 145 black women and 177 white women in Connecticut who were diagnosed with breast cancer between January 1987 and March 1989. Severe obesity was associated with both race and stage at diagnosis: Black women were significantly more likely than white women to be severely obese (26{\%} vs. 7{\%}, respectively), and severe obesity was significantly associated with diagnosis at TNM stage II or greater (multivariate-adjusted odds ratio = 3.10, 95{\%} confidence interval (CI) 1.28-7.52). Adjustment for severe obesity in a logistic regression model reduced the risk of later stage at diagnosis in blacks relative to whites by 33{\%}, from an odds ratio of 1.98 (95{\%} CI 1.22-3.19) to one of 1.66 (95{\%} CI 1.01-2.73). The higher prevalence of severe obesity among black women may play an important role in explaining their relative disadvantage in stage at diagnosis of breast cancer.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Obesity increases the risk of cancer death among postmenopausal women with estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) breast cancer, but the direct evidence for the mechanisms is lacking. The purpose of this study is to demonstrate direct evidence for the mechanisms mediating this epidemiologic phenomenon. METHODS: We analyzed transcriptomic profiles of pretreatment biopsies from a prospective cohort of 137 ER+ breast cancer patients. We generated transgenic (MMTV-TGF$\alpha$;A (y) /a) and orthotopic/syngeneic (A (y) /a) obese mouse models to investigate the effect of obesity on tumorigenesis and tumor progression and to determine biological mechanisms using whole-genome transcriptome microarrays and protein analyses. We used a coculture system to examine the impact of adipocytes/adipokines on breast cancer cell proliferation. All statistical tests were two-sided. RESULTS: Functional transcriptomic analysis of patients revealed the association of obesity with 59 biological functional changes (P {\textless} .05) linked to cancer hallmarks. Gene enrichment analysis revealed enrichment of AKT-target genes (P = .04) and epithelial-mesenchymal transition genes (P = .03) in patients. Our obese mouse models demonstrated activation of the AKT/mTOR pathway in obesity-accelerated mammary tumor growth (3.7- to 7.0-fold; P {\textless} .001; n = 6-7 mice per group). Metformin or everolimus can suppress obesity-induced secretion of adipokines and breast tumor formation and growth (0.5-fold, P = .04; 0.3-fold, P {\textless} .001, respectively; n = 6-8 mice per group). The coculture model revealed that adipocyte-secreted adipokines (eg, TIMP-1) regulate adipocyte-induced breast cancer cell proliferation and invasion. Metformin suppress adipocyte-induced cell proliferation and adipocyte-secreted adipokines in vitro. CONCLUSIONS: Adipokine secretion and AKT/mTOR activation play important roles in obesity-accelerated breast cancer aggressiveness in addition to hyperinsulinemia, estrogen signaling, and inflammation. Metformin and everolimus have potential for therapeutic interventions of ER+ breast cancer patients with obesity.},

abstract = {Major international projects are underway that are aimed at creating a comprehensive catalogue of all the genes responsible for the initiation and progression of cancer. These studies involve the sequencing of matched tumour-normal samples followed by mathematical analysis to identify those genes in which mutations occur more frequently than expected by random chance. Here we describe a fundamental problem with cancer genome studies: as the sample size increases, the list of putatively significant genes produced by current analytical methods burgeons into the hundreds. The list includes many implausible genes (such as those encoding olfactory receptors and the muscle protein titin), suggesting extensive false-positive findings that overshadow true driver events. We show that this problem stems largely from mutational heterogeneity and provide a novel analytical methodology, MutSigCV, for resolving the problem. We apply MutSigCV to exome sequences from 3,083 tumour-normal pairs and discover extraordinary variation in mutation frequency and spectrum within cancer types, which sheds light on mutational processes and disease aetiology, and in mutation frequency across the genome, which is strongly correlated with DNA replication timing and also with transcriptional activity. By incorporating mutational heterogeneity into the analyses, MutSigCV is able to eliminate most of the apparent artefactual findings and enable the identification of genes truly associated with cancer.},

An ability to dissect this heterogeneity, to identify subgroups that represent common mechanisms of disease, will be critical to understanding the complexities of genetic alterations and to provide a framework to develop rational therapeutic strategies. Here, we describe a classification scheme for human breast cancer making use of patterns of pathway activity to build on previous subtype characterizations using intrinsic gene expression signatures, to provide a functional interpretation of the gene expression data that can be linked to therapeutic options. We show that the identified subgroups provide a robust mechanism for classifying independent samples, identifying tumors that share patterns of pathway activity and exhibit similar clinical and biological properties, including distinct patterns of chromosomal alterations that were not evident in the heterogeneous total population of tumors. We propose that this classification scheme provides a basis for understanding the complex mechanisms of oncogenesis that give rise to these tumors and to identify rational opportunities for combination therapies.},

abstract = {Although a few cancer genes are mutated in a high proportion of tumours of a given type ({\textgreater}20{\%}), most are mutated at intermediate frequencies (2-20{\%}). To explore the feasibility of creating a comprehensive catalogue of cancer genes, we analysed somatic point mutations in exome sequences from 4,742 human cancers and their matched normal-tissue samples across 21 cancer types. We found that large-scale genomic analysis can identify nearly all known cancer genes in these tumour types. Our analysis also identified 33 genes that were not previously known to be significantly mutated in cancer, including genes related to proliferation, apoptosis, genome stability, chromatin regulation, immune evasion, RNA processing and protein homeostasis. Down-sampling analysis indicates that larger sample sizes will reveal many more genes mutated at clinically important frequencies. We estimate that near-saturation may be achieved with 600-5,000 samples per tumour type, depending on background mutation frequency. The results may help to guide the next stage of cancer genomics.},

abstract = {Obesity is thought to contribute to worse disease outcome in breast cancer as a result of increased levels of adipocyte-secreted endocrine factors, insulin, and insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) that accelerate tumor cell proliferation and impair treatment response. We examined the effects of patient obesity on primary breast tumor gene expression, by profiling transcription of a set of 103 tumors for which the patients' body mass index (BMI) was ascertained. Sample profiles were stratified according to patients' obesity phenotype defined as normal (BMI {\textless} 25), overweight (BMI 25-29.9), or obese (BMI ≥ 30). Widespread gene expression alterations were evident in breast tumors from obese patients as compared to other tumors, allowing us to define an obesity-associated cancer transcriptional signature of 662 genes. In multiple public expression data sets of breast cancers (representing {\textgreater} 1,500 patients), manifestation of the obesity signature patterns correlated with manifestation of a gene signature for IGF signaling and (to a lesser extent) with lower levels of estrogen receptor. In one patient cohort, manifestation of the obesity signature correlated with shorter time to metastases. A number of small molecules either induced or suppressed the obesity-associated transcriptional program in vitro; estrogens alpha-estradiol, levonorgestrel, and hexestrol induced the program, while several anti-parkinsonian agents targeting neurotransmitter receptor pathways repressed the program. Obesity in breast cancer patients appears to impact the gene expression patterns of the tumor (perhaps as a result of altered body chemistry). These results warrant further investigation of obesity-associated modifiers of breast cancer risk and disease outcome.},

Methods Among incident endometrial cancer case subjects in the National Institutes of Health-AARP Diet and Health Study, we examined associations of prediagnosis BMI (n = 1400) and physical activity (n = 875) with overall and disease-specific 5- and 10-year mortality. Using Cox proportional hazards regression, we estimated hazard ratios (HRs) and 95{\%} confidence intervals (CIs), adjusting for tumor characteristics, treatment, and other risk factors. All statistical tests were two-sided. Results Compared with women with a BMI in the range of 18.5 to less than 25kg/m(2), the hazard ratios for 5-year all-cause mortality were 1.74 (95{\%} CI = 1.13 to 2.66) for BMI in the range of 25 to less than 30kg/m(2), 1.84 (95{\%} CI = 1.17 to 2.88) for BMI in the range of 30 to less than 35kg/m(2), and 2.35 (95{\%} CI = 1.48 to 3.73) for BMI greater than or equal to 35kg/m(2) (P trend {\textless} .001). Higher BMI was also statistically significantly associated with poorer endometrial cancer-specific but not cardiovascular disease 5-year mortality. Hazard ratio estimates for 10-year all-cause and endometrial cancer-specific mortality as related to BMI were similar to 5-year hazard ratio estimates, whereas 10-year cardiovascular disease mortality became statistically significant (HR = 4.08; 95{\%} CI = 1.56 to 10.71 comparing extreme BMI groups). More physical activity was related to lower all-cause 5-year mortality (HR = 0.57, 95{\%} CI = 0.33 to 0.98 for {\textgreater}7 hours/week vs never/rarely), but the association was attenuated after adjustment for BMI (HR = 0.64, 95{\%} CI = 0.37 to 1.12). No association was observed between physical activity and disease-specific mortality. Conclusions Our findings suggest that higher prediagnosis BMI increases risk of overall and disease-specific mortality among women diagnosed with endometrial cancer, whereas physical activity lowers risk. Intervention studies of the effect of these modifiable lifestyle factors on mortality are needed.},

abstract = {The estrogen receptor (ER) pathway plays a pivotal role in breast cancer development and progression. Endocrine therapy to block the ER pathway is highly effective, but its usefulness is limited by common intrinsic and acquired resistance. Multiple mechanisms responsible for endocrine resistance have been proposed and include deregulation of various components of the ER pathway itself, alterations in cell cycle and cell survival signaling molecules, and the activation of escape pathways that can provide tumors with alternative proliferative and survival stimuli. Among these, increased expression or signaling of growth factor receptor pathways, especially the EGFR/HER2 pathway, has been associated with both experimental and clinical endocrine therapy resistance. New treatment combinations targeting both ER and growth factor receptor signaling to block the crosstalk between these pathways and eliminate escape routes have been proven highly effective in preclinical models. Results of recent clinical studies, while partly supporting this approach, also highlight the need to better identify a priori the patients whose tumors are most likely to benefit from these specific cotargeting strategies.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Breast cancer heterogeneity occurs as a consequence of the dysregulation of numerous oncogenic pathways as well as many non-genetic factors, including tumor microenvironmental stresses such as hypoxia, lactic acidosis, and glucose deprivation. Although the importance of these non-genetic factors is well recognized, it is not clear how to integrate these factors within the genetic framework of cancer as the next logical step in understanding tumor heterogeneity.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: We report here the development of a series of gene expression signatures to measure the influences of microenvironmental stresses. The pathway activities of hypoxia, lactic acidosis, acidosis and glucose deprivation were investigated in a collection of 1,143 breast tumors, which have been separated into 17 breast tumor subgroups defined by their distinct patterns of oncogenic pathways. A validation dataset comprised of 547 breast tumors was also used to confirm the major findings, and representative breast cancer cell lines were utilized to validate in silico results and mechanistic studies.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Through the integrative pathway analysis of microenvironmental stresses and oncogenic events in breast tumors, we identified many known and novel correlations between these two sources of tumor heterogeneity. Focusing on differences between two human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-related subgroups, previously identified based on patterns of oncogenic pathway activity, we determined that these subgroups differ with regards to tumor microenvironmental signatures, including hypoxia. We further demonstrate that each of these subgroups have features consistent with basal and luminal breast tumors including patterns of oncogenic signaling pathways, expression of subtype specific genes, and cellular mechanisms that regulate the hypoxia response. Importantly, we also demonstrate that the correlated pattern of hypoxia-related gene expression and basal-associated gene expression are consistent across HER2-related tumors whether we analyze the tumors as a function of our pathway-based classification scheme, using the intrinsic gene list (ERBB2+), or based on HER2 IHC status. Our results demonstrate a cell lineage-specific phenomenon in which basal-like tumors, HER2-related tumors with high hypoxia, as well as normal basal epithelial cells express increased mRNA levels of HIF-1$\alpha$ compared to luminal types and silencing of HIF-1$\alpha$ results in decreased expression of hypoxia-induced genes.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates differences in microenvironmental conditions in HER2-related subgroups defined by distinct oncogenic pathway activities, and provides a mechanistic explanation for differences in the observed hypoxia response between these subgroups. Collectively, these data demonstrate the potential of a pathway-based classification strategy as a framework to integrate genetic and non-genetic factors to investigate the basis of tumor heterogeneity.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Observational studies have reported a positive association between body mass index (BMI) and ovarian cancer risk. However, questions remain as to whether this represents a causal effect, or holds for all histological subtypes. The lack of association observed for serous cancers may, for instance, be due to disease-associated weight loss. Mendelian randomization (MR) uses genetic markers as proxies for risk factors to overcome limitations of observational studies. We used MR to elucidate the relationship between BMI and ovarian cancer, hypothesizing that genetically predicted BMI would be associated with increased risk of non-high grade serous ovarian cancers (non-HGSC) but not HGSC. METHODS We pooled data from 39 studies (14 047 cases, 23 003 controls) in the Ovarian Cancer Association Consortium. We constructed a weighted genetic risk score (GRS, partial F-statistic = 172), summing alleles at 87 single nucleotide polymorphisms previously associated with BMI, weighting by their published strength of association with BMI. Applying two-stage predictor-substitution MR, we used logistic regression to estimate study-specific odds ratios (OR) and 95{\%} confidence intervals (CI) for the association between genetically predicted BMI and risk, and pooled these using random-effects meta-analysis. RESULTS Higher genetically predicted BMI was associated with increased risk of non-HGSC (pooled OR = 1.29, 95{\%} CI 1.03-1.61 per 5 units BMI) but not HGSC (pooled OR = 1.06, 95{\%} CI 0.88-1.27). Secondary analyses stratified by behaviour/subtype suggested that, consistent with observational data, the association was strongest for low-grade/borderline serous cancers (OR = 1.93, 95{\%} CI 1.33-2.81). CONCLUSIONS Our data suggest that higher BMI increases risk of non-HGSC, but not the more common and aggressive HGSC subtype, confirming the observational evidence.},

abstract = {The development of an oncogenic state is a complex process involving the accumulation of multiple independent mutations that lead to deregulation of cell signalling pathways central to the control of cell growth and cell fate. The ability to define cancer subtypes, recurrence of disease and response to specific therapies using DNA microarray-based gene expression signatures has been demonstrated in multiple studies. Various studies have also demonstrated the potential for using gene expression profiles for the analysis of oncogenic pathways. Here we show that gene expression signatures can be identified that reflect the activation status of several oncogenic pathways. When evaluated in several large collections of human cancers, these gene expression signatures identify patterns of pathway deregulation in tumours and clinically relevant associations with disease outcomes. Combining signature-based predictions across several pathways identifies coordinated patterns of pathway deregulation that distinguish between specific cancers and tumour subtypes. Clustering tumours based on pathway signatures further defines prognosis in respective patient subsets, demonstrating that patterns of oncogenic pathway deregulation underlie the development of the oncogenic phenotype and reflect the biology and outcome of specific cancers. Predictions of pathway deregulation in cancer cell lines are also shown to predict the sensitivity to therapeutic agents that target components of the pathway. Linking pathway deregulation with sensitivity to therapeutics that target components of the pathway provides an opportunity to make use of these oncogenic pathway signatures to guide the use of targeted therapeutics.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: The purpose of this retrospective study was to determine the association and prognostic value of body mass index (BMI) at the time of initial diagnosis in patients with locally advanced breast cancer (LABC). The analysis includes the subsets of inflammatory (IBC) and noninflammatory (non-IBC LABC) breast cancer. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We identified 602 patients who had LABC treated on prospective clinical trials. BMI was divided into three groups: (a) {\textless} or =24.9 (normal/underweight), (b) 25.0 to 29.9 (overweight), and (c) {\textgreater} or =30 (obese). Kaplan-Meier product limit method was used to estimate survival outcomes. Cox proportional hazards were used to determine associations between survival and BMI and to test for an interaction between BMI and breast cancer type. RESULTS: Eighty-two percent had non-IBC LABC and 18{\%} had IBC. Obese patients tended to have a higher incidence of IBC compared with overweight and normal/underweight groups (P = 0.01). Median follow up was 6 years for all patients. Median overall survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS) were 8.8 and 5.9 years, respectively. Patients with LABC who were obese or overweight had a significantly worse OS and RFS (P = 0.001) and a higher incidence of visceral recurrence compared with normal/underweight patients. In a multivariable model, BMI remained significantly associated with both OS and RFS for the entire cohort. The interactions between BMI and LABC subsets and between BMI and menopausal status were not statistically significant. CONCLUSION: Patients with LABC and high BMI have a worse prognosis. Evaluation of the biological factors associated with this observation can provide tools for additional therapeutic interventions.},
