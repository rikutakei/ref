abstract = {BACKGROUND: By assaying hundreds of thousands of single nucleotide polymorphisms, genome wide association studies (GWAS) allow for a powerful, unbiased review of the entire genome to localize common genetic variants that influence health and disease. Although it is widely recognized that some correction for multiple testing is necessary, in order to control the family-wide Type 1 Error in genetic association studies, it is not clear which method to utilize. One simple approach is to perform a Bonferroni correction using all n single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) across the genome; however this approach is highly conservative and would "overcorrect" for SNPs that are not truly independent. Many SNPs fall within regions of strong linkage disequilibrium (LD) ("blocks") and should not be considered "independent".$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: We proposed to approximate the number of "independent" SNPs by counting 1 SNP per LD block, plus all SNPs outside of blocks (interblock SNPs). We examined the effective number of independent SNPs for Genome Wide Association Study (GWAS) panels. In the CEPH Utah (CEU) population, by considering the interdependence of SNPs, we could reduce the total number of effective tests within the Affymetrix and Illumina SNP panels from 500,000 and 317,000 to 67,000 and 82,000 "independent" SNPs, respectively. For the Affymetrix 500 K and Illumina 317 K GWAS SNP panels we recommend using 10(-5), 10(-7) and 10(-8) and for the Phase II HapMap CEPH Utah and Yoruba populations we recommend using 10(-6), 10(-7) and 10(-9) as "suggestive", "significant" and "highly significant" p-value thresholds to properly control the family-wide Type 1 error.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: By approximating the effective number of independent SNPs across the genome we are able to 'correct' for a more accurate number of tests and therefore develop 'LD adjusted' Bonferroni corrected p-value thresholds that account for the interdepdendence of SNPs on well-utilized commercially available SNP "chips". These thresholds will serve as guides to researchers trying to decide which regions of the genome should be studied further.},

abstract = {Elucidating the genetic basis of complex traits and diseases in non-European populations is particularly challenging because US minority populations have been under-represented in genetic association studies. We developed an empirical Bayes approach named XPEB (cross-population empirical Bayes), designed to improve the power for mapping complex-trait-associated loci in a minority population by exploiting information from genome-wide association studies (GWASs) from another ethnic population. Taking as input summary statistics from two GWASs - a target GWAS from an ethnic minority population of primary interest and an auxiliary base GWAS (such as a larger GWAS in Europeans) - our XPEB approach reprioritizes SNPs in the target population to compute local false-discovery rates. We demonstrated, through simulations, that whenever the base GWAS harbors relevant information, XPEB gains efficiency. Moreover, XPEB has the ability to discard irrelevant auxiliary information, providing a safeguard against inflated false-discovery rates due to genetic heterogeneity between populations. Applied to a blood-lipids study in African Americans, XPEB more than quadrupled the discoveries from the conventional approach, which used a target GWAS alone, bringing the number of significant loci from 14 to 65. Thus, XPEB offers a flexible framework for mapping complex traits in minority populations.},

The main advantage of this technique is the maximization of power to detect subtle genetic effects for common traits. Moreover, one can use meta-analysis to probe and identify heterogeneity in the effect sizes across the combined studies. In this review, we systematically appraise and evaluate the characteristics of GWA meta-analyses with 10,000 or more subjects published up to June 2012. We provide an overview of the current landscape of variants discovered by GWA meta-analyses, and we discuss and assess with extrapolations from empirical data the value of larger meta-analyses for the discovery of additional genetic associations and new biology in the future. Finally, we discuss some emerging logistical and practical issues related to the conduct of meta-analysis of GWA studies.},

@article{Spielman1993,
abstract = {A population association has consistently been observed between insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) and the "class 1" alleles of the region of tandem-repeat DNA (5' flanking polymorphism [5'FP]) adjacent to the insulin gene on chromosome 11p. This finding suggests that the insulin gene region contains a gene or genes contributing to IDDM susceptibility. However, several studies that have sought to show linkage with IDDM by testing for cosegregation in affected sib pairs have failed to find evidence for linkage. As means for identifying genes for complex diseases, both the association and the affected-sib-pairs approaches have limitations. It is well known that population association between a disease and a genetic marker can arise as an artifact of population structure, even in the absence of linkage. On the other hand, linkage studies with modest numbers of affected sib pairs may fail to detect linkage, especially if there is linkage heterogeneity. We consider an alternative method to test for linkage with a genetic marker when population association has been found. Using data from families with at least one affected child, we evaluate the transmission of the associated marker allele from a heterozygous parent to an affected offspring. This approach has been used by several investigators, but the statistical properties of the method as a test for linkage have not been investigated. In the present paper we describe the statistical basis for this "transmission test for linkage disequilibrium" (transmission/disequilibrium test [TDT]). We then show the relationship of this test to tests of cosegregation that are based on the proportion of haplotypes or genes identical by descent in affected sibs. The TDT provides strong evidence for linkage between the 5'FP and susceptibility to IDDM. The conclusions from this analysis apply in general to the study of disease associations, where genetic markers are usually closely linked to candidate genes. When a disease is found to be associated with such a marker, the TDT may detect linkage even when haplotype-sharing tests do not.},

abstract = {Studies that traverse ancestrally diverse populations may increase power to detect novel loci and improve fine-mapping resolution of causal variants by leveraging linkage disequilibrium differences between ethnic groups. The inclusion of African ancestry samples may yield further improvements because of low linkage disequilibrium and high genetic heterogeneity. We investigate the fine-mapping resolution of trans-ethnic fixed-effects meta-analysis for five type II diabetes loci, under various settings of ancestral composition (European, East Asian, African), allelic heterogeneity, and causal variant minor allele frequency. In particular, three settings of ancestral composition were compared: (1) single ancestry (European), (2) moderate ancestral diversity (European and East Asian), and (3) high ancestral diversity (European, East Asian, and African). Our simulations suggest that the European/Asian and European ancestry-only meta-analyses consistently attain similar fine-mapping resolution. The inclusion of African ancestry samples in the meta-analysis leads to a marked improvement in fine-mapping resolution. INTRODUCTION Numerous genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have been carried out, resulting in the identification of many susceptibility loci for a wide range of complex traits. 1 The detection of additional loci has resulted from GWAS meta-analyses (primarily in populations of European descent) and has been aided by imputation that allows the prediction of genotypes not typed on GWAS chips, but present in a higher density reference. Nonetheless, the joint effects of the loci identified to date have only accounted for a small proportion of the heritability of complex traits. Because of linkage disequilibrium (LD), many variants within identified loci have indistinguishable signals. This LD is beneficial to GWAS, as it increases the power to detect new associations, when the causal variant is not directly typed. However, the caveat to this is that it limits the potential of fine-mapping efforts to refine the location of causal variants. GWAS data from non-European populations are increasing in availability, and this provides the opportunity to meta-analyse GWAS across ancestrally diverse populations. Trans-ethnic meta-analysis may lead to an increase in power to detect novel loci and may improve fine-mapping resolution of causal variants by leveraging differences in the structure of LD between diverse populations. 2,3 The inclusion of African ancestry samples may yield substantial improvements in localisation of causal variants because of low LD and high genetic heterogeneity. 4 Several trans-ethnic analyses have shown empirical improvements in fine-mapping resolution. Examples include a refinement of signals at several type II diabetes loci in an analysis involving samples of European, East Asian, South Asian, and Mexican and Mexican-American ancestry, 5 as well as in previously identified adiposity loci in a trans-ethnic meta-analysis of samples from European and African ancestries. 6 Similarly, a refinement of signals was obtained at several lipid trait loci in a trans-ethnic fine-mapping study involving},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: As we enter an era when testing millions of SNPs in a single gene association study will become the standard, consideration of multiple comparisons is an essential part of determining statistical significance. Bonferroni adjustments can be made but are conservative due to the preponderance of linkage disequilibrium (LD) between genetic markers, and permutation testing is not always a viable option. Three major classes of corrections have been proposed to correct the dependent nature of genetic data in Bonferroni adjustments: permutation testing and related alternatives, principal components analysis (PCA), and analysis of blocks of LD across the genome. We consider seven implementations of these commonly used methods using data from 1514 European American participants genotyped for 700,078 SNPs in a GWAS for AIDS.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: A Bonferroni correction using the number of LD blocks found by the three algorithms implemented by Haploview resulted in an insufficiently conservative threshold, corresponding to a genome-wide significance level of $\alpha$ = 0.15 - 0.20. We observed a moderate increase in power when using PRESTO, SLIDE, and simpleℳ when compared with traditional Bonferroni methods for population data genotyped on the Affymetrix 6.0 platform in European Americans ($\alpha$ = 0.05 thresholds between 1 × 10(-7) and 7 × 10(-8)).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Correcting for the number of LD blocks resulted in an anti-conservative Bonferroni adjustment. SLIDE and simpleℳ are particularly useful when using a statistical test not handled in optimized permutation testing packages, and genome-wide corrected p-values using SLIDE, are much easier to interpret for consumers of GWAS studies.},

abstract = {Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) are the method most often used by geneticists to interrogate the human genome, and they provide a cost-effective way to identify the genetic variants underpinning complex traits and diseases. Most initial GWASs have focused on genetically homogeneous cohorts from European populations given the limited availability of ethnic minority samples and so as to limit population stratification effects. Transethnic studies have been invaluable in explaining the heritability of common quantitative traits, such as height, and in examining the genetic architecture of complex diseases, such as type 2 diabetes. They provide an opportunity for large-scale signal replication in independent populations and for cross-population meta-analyses to boost statistical power. In addition, transethnic GWASs enable prioritization of candidate genes, fine-mapping of functional variants, and potentially identification of SNPs associated with disease risk in admixed populations, by taking advantage of natural differences in genomic linkage disequilibrium across ethnically diverse populations. Recent efforts to assess the biological function of variants identified by GWAS have highlighted the need for large-scale replication, meta-analyses and fine-mapping across worldwide populations of ethnically diverse genetic ancestries. Here, we review recent advances and new approaches that are important to consider when performing, designing or interpreting transethnic GWASs, and we highlight existing challenges, such as the limited ability to handle heterogeneity in linkage disequilibrium across populations and limitations in dissecting complex architectures, such as those found in recently admixed populations.},

Although several reference panels are available, it is often not clear which is the most optimal for a particular target dataset to be imputed. Maximizing genetic similarity between study sample and intended reference panels may be the straight forward method for selecting the genetically best-matched reference. However, the impact of genetic similarity on imputation accuracy has not yet been studied in detail.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: We performed a simulation study in 20 ethnic groups obtained from POPRES. High-quality SNPs were masked and re-imputed with MaCH, MaCH-minimac and IMPUTE2 using four different HapMap reference panels (CEU, CHB-JPT, MEX and YRI). Imputation accuracy was assessed by different statistics. Genetic similarity between ethnic groups and reference populations were measured by F -statistics (F ST ) originally proposed by Wright and G -statistics (G ST ) introduced by Nei and others. To assess the predictive power of these measures regarding imputation accuracy, we analysed relations between them and corresponding imputation accuracy scores. We found that population genetic distances between homogeneous reference and target populations were strongly linearly correlated with resulting imputation accuracies irrespective of considered distance measure, imputation accuracy measure, missingness and imputation software used. Possible exception was African population.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: Usage of G ST or F ST -related measures for predicting the optimal reference panel for imputation frameworks relying on a specific reference is highly recommended. A cut-off of G ST {\textless} 0.01 is recommended to achieve good imputation results for high-frequency variants and small data sets. The linear relationship is less pronounced for low-frequency variants for which we also observed a dependence of imputation accuracy on the number of polymorphic sites in the reference. We also show that the software specific measures MaCH-Rsq and IMPUTE-info must be interpreted with caution if the genetic distance of target and reference population is high.},

abstract = {Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) are commonly used for the mapping of genetic loci that influence complex traits. A problem that is often encountered in both population-based and family-based GWASs is that of identifying cryptic relatedness and population stratification because it is well known that failure to appropriately account for both pedigree and population structure can lead to spurious association. A number of methods have been proposed for identifying relatives in samples from homogeneous populations. A strong assumption of population homogeneity, however, is often untenable, and many GWASs include samples from structured populations. Here, we consider the problem of estimating relatedness in structured populations with admixed ancestry. We propose a method, REAP (relatedness estimation in admixed populations), for robust estimation of identity by descent (IBD)-sharing probabilities and kinship coefficients in admixed populations. REAP appropriately accounts for population structure and ancestry-related assortative mating by using individual-specific allele frequencies at SNPs that are calculated on the basis of ancestry derived from whole-genome analysis. In simulation studies with related individuals and admixture from highly divergent populations, we demonstrate that REAP gives accurate IBD-sharing probabilities and kinship coefficients. We apply REAP to the Mexican Americans in Los Angeles, California (MXL) population sample of release 3 of phase III of the International Haplotype Map Project; in this sample, we identify third- and fourth-degree relatives who have not previously been reported. We also apply REAP to the African American and Hispanic samples from the Women's Health Initiative SNP Health Association Resource (WHI-SHARe) study, in which hundreds of pairs of cryptically related individuals have been identified. {\textcopyright} 2012 The American Society of Human Genetics.},

abstract = {A dense set of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) covering the genome and an efficient method to assess SNP genotypes are expected to be available in the near future. An outstanding question is how to use these technologies efficiently to identify genes affecting liability to complex disorders. To achieve this goal, we propose a statistical method that has several optimal properties: It can be used with case control data and yet, like family-based designs, controls for population heterogeneity; it is insensitive to the usual violations of model assumptions, such as cases failing to be strictly independent; and, by using Bayesian outlier methods, it circumvents the need for Bonferroni correction for multiple tests, leading to better performance in many settings while still constraining risk for false positives. The performance of our genomic control method is quite good for plausible effects of liability genes, which bodes well for future genetic analyses of complex disorders.},

abstract = {Meta-analysis is an increasingly popular tool for combining multiple different genome-wide association studies (GWASs) in a single aggregate analysis in order to identify associations with very small effect sizes. Because the data of a meta-analysis can be heterogeneous, referring to the differences in effect sizes between the collected studies, what is often done in the literature is to apply both the fixed-effects model (FE) under an assumption of the same effect size between studies and the random-effects model (RE) under an assumption of varying effect size between studies. However, surprisingly, RE gives less significant p values than FE at variants that actually show varying effect sizes between studies. This is ironic because RE is designed specifically for the case in which there is heterogeneity. As a result, usually, RE does not discover any associations that FE did not discover. In this paper, we show that the underlying reason for this phenomenon is that RE implicitly assumes a markedly conservative null-hypothesis model, and we present a new random-effects model that relaxes the conservative assumption. Unlike the traditional RE, the new method is shown to achieve higher statistical power than FE when there is heterogeneity, indicating that the new method has practical utility for discovering associations in the meta-analysis of GWASs. ?? 2011 The American Society of Human Genetics.},

abstract = {Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have discovered thousands of variants that are associated with human health and disease. Whilst early GWASs have primarily focused on genetically homogeneous populations of European, East Asian and South Asian ancestries, the next-generation genome-wide surveys are starting to pool studies from ethnically diverse populations within a single meta-analysis. However, classical epidemiological strategies for meta-analyses that assume fixed- or random-effects may not be the most suitable approaches to combine GWAS findings as these either confer low statistical power or identify mostly loci where the variants carry homogeneous effect sizes that are present in most of the studies. In a trans-ethnic meta-analysis, it is likely that some genetic loci will exhibit heterogeneous effect sizes across the populations. This may be due to differences in study designs, differences arising from the interactions with other genetic variants, or genuine biological differences attributed to environmental, dietary or lifestyle factors that modulate the influence of the genes. Here we compare different strategies for meta-analyzing GWAS across genetically diverse populations, where we intentionally vary the effect sizes present across the different populations. We subsequently applied the methods that yielded the highest statistical power to a trans-ethnic meta-analysis of seven GWAS in type 2 diabetes, and showed that these methods identified bona fide associations that would otherwise have been missed by the classical strategies.},

abstract = {Meta-analysis is an increasingly popular tool for combining multiple genome-wide association studies in a single analysis to identify associations with small effect sizes. The effect sizes between studies in a meta-analysis may differ and these differences, or heterogeneity, can be caused by many factors. If heterogeneity is observed in the results of a meta-analysis, interpreting the cause of heterogeneity is important because the correct interpretation can lead to a better understanding of the disease and a more effective design of a replication study. However, interpreting heterogeneous results is difficult. The standard approach of examining the association p-values of the studies does not effectively predict if the effect exists in each study. In this paper, we propose a framework facilitating the interpretation of the results of a meta-analysis. Our framework is based on a new statistic representing the posterior probability that the effect exists in each study, which is estimated utilizing cross-study information. Simulations and application to the real data show that our framework can effectively segregate the studies predicted to have an effect, the studies predicted to not have an effect, and the ambiguous studies that are underpowered. In addition to helping interpretation, the new framework also allows us to develop a new association testing procedure taking into account the existence of effect.},

Many treatments of the problem consider only a simple "island" model of population structure. We take a broader approach, which views population structure and cryptic relatedness as different aspects of a single confounder: the unobserved pedigree defining the (often distant) relationships among the study subjects. Kinship is therefore a central concept, and we review methods of defining and estimating kinship coefficients, both pedigree-based and marker-based. In this unified framework we review solutions to the problem of population structure, including family-based study designs, genomic control, structured association, regression control, principal components adjustment and linear mixed models. The last solution makes the most explicit use of the kinships among the study subjects, and has an established role in the analysis of animal and plant breeding studies. Recent computational developments mean that analyses of human genetic association data are beginning to benefit from its powerful tests for association, which protect against population structure and cryptic kinship, as well as intermediate levels of confounding by the pedigree.},

abstract = {In genetic association studies (GAS) as well as in genome-wide association studies (GWAS), the mode of inheritance (dominant, additive and recessive) is usually not known a priori. Assuming an incorrect mode of inheritance may lead to substantial loss of power, whereas on the other hand, testing all possible models may result in an increased type I error rate. The situation is even more complicated in the meta-analysis of GAS or GWAS, in which individual studies are synthesized to derive an overall estimate. Meta-analysis increases the power to detect weak genotype effects, but heterogeneity and incompatibility between the included studies complicate things further. In this review, we present a comprehensive summary of the statistical methods used for robust analysis and genetic model selection in GAS and GWAS. We then discuss the application of such methods in the context of meta-analysis. We describe the theoretical properties of the various methods and the foundations on which they are based. We also present the available software implementations of the described methods. Finally, since only few of the available robust methods have been applied in the meta-analysis setting, we present some simple extensions that allow robust meta-analysis of GAS and GWAS. Possible extensions and proposals for future work are also discussed.},

The advantages of the mixed-linear-model association (MLMA) method include the prevention of false positive associations due to population or relatedness structure and an increase in power obtained through the application of a correction that is specific to this structure. An underappreciated point is that MLMA can also increase power in studies without sample structure by implicitly conditioning on associated loci other than the candidate locus. Numerous variations on the standard MLMA approach have recently been published, with a focus on reducing computational cost. These advances provide researchers applying MLMA methods with many options to choose from, but we caution that MLMA methods are still subject to potential pitfalls.

abstract = {A variety of modern software packages are available for genotype imputation relying on advanced concepts such as pre-phasing of the target dataset or utilization of admixed reference panels. In this study, we performed a comprehensive evaluation of the accuracy of modern imputation methods on the basis of the publicly available POPRES samples. Good quality genotypes were masked and re-imputed by different imputation frameworks: namely MaCH, IMPUTE2, MaCH-Minimac, SHAPEIT-IMPUTE2 and MaCH-Admix. Results were compared to evaluate the relative merit of pre-phasing and the usage of admixed references. We showed that the pre-phasing framework SHAPEIT-IMPUTE2 can overestimate the certainty of genotype distributions resulting in the lowest percentage of correctly imputed genotypes in our case. MaCH-Minimac performed better than SHAPEIT-IMPUTE2. Pre-phasing always reduced imputation accuracy. IMPUTE2 and MaCH-Admix, both relying on admixed-reference panels, showed comparable results. MaCH showed superior results if well-matched references were available (Nei's GST ≤ 0.010). For small to medium datasets, frameworks using genetically closest reference panel are recommended if the genetic distance between target and reference data set is small. Our results are valid for small to medium data sets. As shown on a larger data set of population based German samples, the disadvantage of pre-phasing decreases for larger sample sizes.},

abstract = {The analysis of less common variants in genome-wide association studies promises to elucidate complex trait genetics but is hampered by low power to reliably detect association. We show that addition of population-specific exome sequence data to global reference data allows more accurate imputation, particularly of less common SNPs (minor allele frequency 1-10{\%}) in two very different European populations. The imputation improvement corresponds to an increase in effective sample size of 28-38{\%}, for SNPs with a minor allele frequency in the range 1-3{\%}.},

abstract = {To further understanding of the genetic basis of type 2 diabetes (T2D) susceptibility, we aggregated published meta-analyses of genome-wide association studies (GWAS), including 26,488 cases and 83,964 controls of European, east Asian, south Asian and Mexican and Mexican American ancestry. We observed a significant excess in the directional consistency of T2D risk alleles across ancestry groups, even at SNPs demonstrating only weak evidence of association. By following up the strongest signals of association from the trans-ethnic meta-analysis in an additional 21,491 cases and 55,647 controls of European ancestry, we identified seven new T2D susceptibility loci. Furthermore, we observed considerable improvements in the fine-mapping resolution of common variant association signals at several T2D susceptibility loci. These observations highlight the benefits of trans-ethnic GWAS for the discovery and characterization of complex trait loci and emphasize an exciting opportunity to extend insight into the genetic architecture and pathogenesis of human diseases across populations of diverse ancestry.},

abstract = {Accounting for the genetic substructure of human populations has become a major practical issue for studying complex genetic disorders. Allele frequency differences among ethnic groups and subgroups and admixture between different ethnic groups can result in frequent false-positive results or reduced power in genetic studies. Here, we review the problems and progress in defining population differences and the application of statistical methods to improve association studies. It is now possible to take into account the confounding effects of population stratification using thousands of unselected genome-wide single-nucleotide polymorphisms or, alternatively, selected panels of ancestry informative markers. These methods do not require any demographic information and therefore can be widely applied to genotypes available from multiple sources. We further suggest that it will be important to explore results in homogeneous population subsets as we seek to define the extent to which genomic variation influences complex phenotypes.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Despite the recent success of genome-wide association studies in identifying novel loci contributing effects to complex human traits, such as type 2 diabetes and obesity, much of the genetic component of variation in these phenotypes remains unexplained. One way to improving power to detect further novel loci is through meta-analysis of studies from the same population, increasing the sample size over any individual study. Although statistical software analysis packages incorporate routines for meta-analysis, they are ill equipped to meet the challenges of the scale and complexity of data generated in genome-wide association studies. RESULTS We have developed flexible, open-source software for the meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies. The software incorporates a variety of error trapping facilities, and provides a range of meta-analysis summary statistics. The software is distributed with scripts that allow simple formatting of files containing the results of each association study and generate graphical summaries of genome-wide meta-analysis results. CONCLUSIONS The GWAMA (Genome-Wide Association Meta-Analysis) software has been developed to perform meta-analysis of summary statistics generated from genome-wide association studies of dichotomous phenotypes or quantitative traits.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Rare variants have gathered increasing attention as a possible alternative source of missing heritability. Since next generation sequencing technology is not yet cost-effective for large-scale genomic studies, a widely used alternative approach is imputation. However, the imputation approach may be limited by the low accuracy of the imputed rare variants. To improve imputation accuracy of rare variants, various approaches have been suggested, including increasing the sample size of the reference panel, using sequencing data from study-specific samples (i.e., specific populations), and using local reference panels by genotyping or sequencing a subset of study samples. While these approaches mainly utilize reference panels, imputation accuracy of rare variants can also be increased by using exome chips containing rare variants. The exome chip contains 250 K rare variants selected from the discovered variants of about 12,000 sequenced samples. If exome chip data are available for previously genotyped samples, the combined approach using a genotype panel of merged data, including exome chips and SNP chips, should increase the imputation accuracy of rare variants.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: In this study, we describe a combined imputation which uses both exome chip and SNP chip data simultaneously as a genotype panel. The effectiveness and performance of the combined approach was demonstrated using a reference panel of 848 samples constructed using exome sequencing data from the T2D-GENES consortium and 5,349 sample genotype panels consisting of an exome chip and SNP chip. As a result, the combined approach increased imputation quality up to 11 {\%}, and genomic coverage for rare variants up to 117.7 {\%} (MAF {\textless} 1 {\%}), compared to imputation using the SNP chip alone. Also, we investigated the systematic effect of reference panels on imputation quality using five reference panels and three genotype panels. The best performing approach was the combination of the study specific reference panel and the genotype panel of combined data.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates that combined datasets, including SNP chips and exome chips, enhances both the imputation quality and genomic coverage of rare variants.},

Both fixed effects (FE) and random effects (RE) meta-analysis models have been used widely in published meta-analyses. This article shows that FE models typically manifest a substantial Type I bias in significance tests for mean effect sizes and for moderator variables (interactions), while RE models do not. Likewise, FE models, but not RE models, yield confidence intervals for mean effect sizes that are narrower than their nominal width, thereby overstating the degree of precision in meta-analysis findings. This article demonstrates analytically that these biases in FE procedures are large enough to create serious distortions in conclusions about cumulative knowledge in the research literature. We therefore recommend that RE methods routinely be employed in meta-analysis in preference to FE methods.},

abstract = {The detection of loci contributing effects to complex human traits, and their subsequent fine-mapping for the location of causal variants, remains a considerable challenge for the genetics research community. Meta-analyses of genomewide association studies, primarily ascertained from European-descent populations, have made considerable advances in our understanding of complex trait genetics, although much of their heritability is still unexplained. With the increasing availability of genomewide association data from diverse populations, transethnic meta-analysis may offer an exciting opportunity to increase the power to detect novel complex trait loci and to improve the resolution of fine-mapping of causal variants by leveraging differences in local linkage disequilibrium structure between ethnic groups. However, we might also expect there to be substantial genetic heterogeneity between diverse populations, both in terms of the spectrum of causal variants and their allelic effects, which cannot easily be accommodated through traditional approaches to meta-analysis. In order to address this challenge, I propose novel transethnic meta-analysis methodology that takes account of the expected similarity in allelic effects between the most closely related populations, while allowing for heterogeneity between more diverse ethnic groups. This approach yields substantial improvements in performance, compared to fixed-effects meta-analysis, both in terms of power to detect association, and localization of the causal variant, over a range of models of heterogeneity between ethnic groups. Furthermore, when the similarity in allelic effects between populations is well captured by their relatedness, this approach has increased power and mapping resolution over random-effects meta-analysis.},

abstract = {Too many reports of associations between genetic variants and common cancer sites and other complex diseases are false positives. A major reason for this unfortunate situation is the strategy of declaring statistical significance based on a P value alone, particularly, any P value below .05. The false positive report probability (FPRP), the probability of no true association between a genetic variant and disease given a statistically significant finding, depends not only on the ob- served P value but also on both the prior probability that the association between the genetic variant and the disease is real and the statistical power of the test. In this commentary, we show how to assess the FPRP and how to use it to decide whether a finding is deserving of attention or “noteworthy.” We show how this approach can lead to improvements in the design, analysis, and interpretation of molecular epidemiology studies. Our proposal can help investigators, editors, and read- ers of research articles to protect themselves from overinter- preting statistically significant findings that are not likely to signify a true association. An FPRP-based criterion for decid- ing whether to call a finding noteworthy formalizes the process already used informally by investigators—that is, tempering enthusiasm for remarkable study findings with considerations of plausibility.},

abstract = {Linkage analysis with genetic markers has been successful in the localization of genes for many monogenic human diseases. In studies of complex diseases, however, tests that rely on linkage disequilibrium (the simultaneous presence of linkage and association) are often more powerful than those that rely on linkage alone. This advantage is illustrated by the transmission/disequilibrium test (TDT). The TDT requires data (marker genotypes) for affected individuals and their parents; for some diseases, however, data from parents may be difficult or impossible to obtain. In this article, we describe a method, called the "sib TDT" (or "S-TDT"), that overcomes this problem by use of marker data from unaffected sibs instead of from parents, thus allowing application of the principle of the TDT to sibships without parental data. In a single collection of families, there might be some that can be analyzed only by the TDT and others that are suitable for analysis by the S-TDT. We show how all the data may be used jointly in one overall TDT-type procedure that tests for linkage in the presence of association. These extensions of the TDT will be valuable for the study of diseases of late onset, such as non-insulin-dependent diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and other diseases associated with aging.},

abstract = {Current genome-wide association studies (GWAS) use commercial genotyping microarrays that can assay over a million single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). The number of SNPs is further boosted by advanced statistical genotype-imputation algorithms and large SNP databases for reference human populations. The testing of a huge number of SNPs needs to be taken into account in the interpretation of statistical significance in such genome-wide studies, but this is complicated by the non-independence of SNPs because of linkage disequilibrium (LD). Several previous groups have proposed the use of the effective number of independent markers (M(e)) for the adjustment of multiple testing, but current methods of calculation for M(e) are limited in accuracy or computational speed. Here, we report a more robust and fast method to calculate M(e). Applying this efficient method [implemented in a free software tool named Genetic type 1 error calculator (GEC)], we systematically examined the M(e), and the corresponding p-value thresholds required to control the genome-wide type 1 error rate at 0.05, for 13 Illumina or Affymetrix genotyping arrays, as well as for HapMap Project and 1000 Genomes Project datasets which are widely used in genotype imputation as reference panels. Our results suggested the use of a p-value threshold of {\~{}}10(-7) as the criterion for genome-wide significance for early commercial genotyping arrays, but slightly more stringent p-value thresholds {\~{}}5 × 10(-8) for current or merged commercial genotyping arrays, {\~{}}10(-8) for all common SNPs in the 1000 Genomes Project dataset and {\~{}}5 × 10(-8) for the common SNPs only within genes.;},

abstract = {Meta-analysis of trans-ethnic genome-wide association studies (GWAS) has proven to be a practical and profitable approach for identifying loci that contribute to the risk of complex diseases. However, the expected genetic effect heterogeneity cannot easily be accommodated through existing fixed-effects and random-effects methods. In response, we propose a novel random effect model for trans-ethnic meta-analysis with flexible modeling of the expected genetic effect heterogeneity across diverse populations. Specifically, we adopt a modified random effect model from the kernel regression framework, in which genetic effect coefficients are random variables whose correlation structure reflects the genetic distances across ancestry groups. In addition, we use the adaptive variance component test to achieve robust power regardless of the degree of genetic effect heterogeneity. Simulation studies show that our proposed method has well-calibrated type I error rates at very stringent significance levels and can improve power over the traditional meta-analysis methods. We reanalyzed the published type 2 diabetes GWAS meta-analysis (Consortium et al., 2014) and successfully identified one additional SNP that clearly exhibits genetic effect heterogeneity across different ancestry groups. Furthermore, our proposed method provides scalable computing time for genome-wide datasets, in which an analysis of one million SNPs would require less than 3 hours. {\textcopyright} 2016, The International Biometric Society},

abstract = {Although genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have identified numerous loci associated with complex traits, imprecise modeling of the genetic relatedness within study samples may cause substantial inflation of test statistics and possibly spurious associations. Variance component approaches, such as efficient mixed-model association (EMMA), can correct for a wide range of sample structures by explicitly accounting for pairwise relatedness between individuals, using high-density markers to model the phenotype distribution; but such approaches are computationally impractical. We report here a variance component approach implemented in publicly available software, EMMA eXpedited (EMMAX), that reduces the computational time for analyzing large GWAS data sets from years to hours. We apply this method to two human GWAS data sets, performing association analysis for ten quantitative traits from the Northern Finland Birth Cohort and seven common diseases from the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium. We find that EMMAX outperforms both principal component analysis and genomic control in correcting for sample structure.},
