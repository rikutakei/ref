abstract = {In the past few years genome-wide association (GWA) studies have uncovered a large number of convincingly replicated associations for many complex human diseases. Genotype imputation has been used widely in the analysis of GWA studies to boost power, fine-map associations and facilitate the combination of results across studies using meta-analysis. This Review describes the details of several different statistical methods for imputing genotypes, illustrates and discusses the factors that influence imputation performance, and reviews methods that can be used to assess imputation performance and test association at imputed SNPs.;},

abstract = {Genetic factors strongly affect susceptibility to common diseases and also influence disease-related quantitative traits. Identifying the relevant genes has been difficult, in part because each causal gene only makes a small contribution to overall heritability. Genetic association studies offer a potentially powerful approach for mapping causal genes with modest effects, but are limited because only a small number of genes can be studied at a time. Genome-wide association studies will soon become possible, and could open new frontiers in our understanding and treatment of disease. However, the execution and analysis of such studies will require great care.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Genotype imputation is a common technique in genetic research. Genetic similarity between target population and reference dataset is crucial for high-quality results. Although several reference panels are available, it is often not clear which is the most optimal for a particular target dataset to be imputed. Maximizing genetic similarity between study sample and intended reference panels may be the straight forward method for selecting the genetically best-matched reference. However, the impact of genetic similarity on imputation accuracy has not yet been studied in detail.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: We performed a simulation study in 20 ethnic groups obtained from POPRES. High-quality SNPs were masked and re-imputed with MaCH, MaCH-minimac and IMPUTE2 using four different HapMap reference panels (CEU, CHB-JPT, MEX and YRI). Imputation accuracy was assessed by different statistics. Genetic similarity between ethnic groups and reference populations were measured by F -statistics (F ST ) originally proposed by Wright and G -statistics (G ST ) introduced by Nei and others. To assess the predictive power of these measures regarding imputation accuracy, we analysed relations between them and corresponding imputation accuracy scores. We found that population genetic distances between homogeneous reference and target populations were strongly linearly correlated with resulting imputation accuracies irrespective of considered distance measure, imputation accuracy measure, missingness and imputation software used. Possible exception was African population.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: Usage of G ST or F ST -related measures for predicting the optimal reference panel for imputation frameworks relying on a specific reference is highly recommended. A cut-off of G ST  {\textless} 0.01 is recommended to achieve good imputation results for high-frequency variants and small data sets. The linear relationship is less pronounced for low-frequency variants for which we also observed a dependence of imputation accuracy on the number of polymorphic sites in the reference. We also show that the software specific measures MaCH-Rsq and IMPUTE-info must be interpreted with caution if the genetic distance of target and reference population is high.},

@article{Kim2015,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Rare variants have gathered increasing attention as a possible alternative source of missing heritability. Since next generation sequencing technology is not yet cost-effective for large-scale genomic studies, a widely used alternative approach is imputation. However, the imputation approach may be limited by the low accuracy of the imputed rare variants. To improve imputation accuracy of rare variants, various approaches have been suggested, including increasing the sample size of the reference panel, using sequencing data from study-specific samples (i.e., specific populations), and using local reference panels by genotyping or sequencing a subset of study samples. While these approaches mainly utilize reference panels, imputation accuracy of rare variants can also be increased by using exome chips containing rare variants. The exome chip contains 250 K rare variants selected from the discovered variants of about 12,000 sequenced samples. If exome chip data are available for previously genotyped samples, the combined approach using a genotype panel of merged data, including exome chips and SNP chips, should increase the imputation accuracy of rare variants.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: In this study, we describe a combined imputation which uses both exome chip and SNP chip data simultaneously as a genotype panel. The effectiveness and performance of the combined approach was demonstrated using a reference panel of 848 samples constructed using exome sequencing data from the T2D-GENES consortium and 5,349 sample genotype panels consisting of an exome chip and SNP chip. As a result, the combined approach increased imputation quality up to 11 {\%}, and genomic coverage for rare variants up to 117.7 {\%} (MAF {\textless} 1 {\%}), compared to imputation using the SNP chip alone. Also, we investigated the systematic effect of reference panels on imputation quality using five reference panels and three genotype panels. The best performing approach was the combination of the study specific reference panel and the genotype panel of combined data.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates that combined datasets, including SNP chips and exome chips, enhances both the imputation quality and genomic coverage of rare variants.},

abstract = {A variety of modern software packages are available for genotype imputation relying on advanced concepts such as pre-phasing of the target dataset or utilization of admixed reference panels. In this study, we performed a comprehensive evaluation of the accuracy of modern imputation methods on the basis of the publicly available POPRES samples. Good quality genotypes were masked and re-imputed by different imputation frameworks: namely MaCH, IMPUTE2, MaCH-Minimac, SHAPEIT-IMPUTE2 and MaCH-Admix. Results were compared to evaluate the relative merit of pre-phasing and the usage of admixed references. We showed that the pre-phasing framework SHAPEIT-IMPUTE2 can overestimate the certainty of genotype distributions resulting in the lowest percentage of correctly imputed genotypes in our case. MaCH-Minimac performed better than SHAPEIT-IMPUTE2. Pre-phasing always reduced imputation accuracy. IMPUTE2 and MaCH-Admix, both relying on admixed-reference panels, showed comparable results. MaCH showed superior results if well-matched references were available (Nei's GST ≤ 0.010). For small to medium datasets, frameworks using genetically closest reference panel are recommended if the genetic distance between target and reference data set is small. Our results are valid for small to medium data sets. As shown on a larger data set of population based German samples, the disadvantage of pre-phasing decreases for larger sample sizes.},

abstract = {The detection of loci contributing effects to complex human traits, and their subsequent fine-mapping for the location of causal variants, remains a considerable challenge for the genetics research community. Meta-analyses of genomewide association studies, primarily ascertained from European-descent populations, have made considerable advances in our understanding of complex trait genetics, although much of their heritability is still unexplained. With the increasing availability of genomewide association data from diverse populations, transethnic meta-analysis may offer an exciting opportunity to increase the power to detect novel complex trait loci and to improve the resolution of fine-mapping of causal variants by leveraging differences in local linkage disequilibrium structure between ethnic groups. However, we might also expect there to be substantial genetic heterogeneity between diverse populations, both in terms of the spectrum of causal variants and their allelic effects, which cannot easily be accommodated through traditional approaches to meta-analysis. In order to address this challenge, I propose novel transethnic meta-analysis methodology that takes account of the expected similarity in allelic effects between the most closely related populations, while allowing for heterogeneity between more diverse ethnic groups. This approach yields substantial improvements in performance, compared to fixed-effects meta-analysis, both in terms of power to detect association, and localization of the causal variant, over a range of models of heterogeneity between ethnic groups. Furthermore, when the similarity in allelic effects between populations is well captured by their relatedness, this approach has increased power and mapping resolution over random-effects meta-analysis.},
